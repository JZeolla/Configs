# File Type:       Configuration
# Version:         1.2
# Repository:      https://github.com/JonZeolla
# Description:     This is a high level rsyslog configuration file for accepting JSON-formatted messages, most focused on loading the correct modules and setting the global directives.
#
# Notes
# - This should be accompanied by a secondary config file which parses and stores the syslog messages.
# - Anything that has a placeholder value is tagged with TODO.
# - This config file mixes rsyslog "legacy format" (pre-6.3.3) with the new format due to a lack of documentation as of 2015-02-01 (External link - http://blog.gerhards.net/2011/07/rsyslog-633-config-format-improvements.html).
# - rsyslog source is available on GitHub (External link - https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog).
# - rsyslog documentation is available on the rsyslog website (External link - http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/).
